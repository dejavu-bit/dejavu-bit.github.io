<h5> Welcome to my Website!</h5>
<p>
  -- The network is in the middle of a huge disruption that’s happening in the Enterprise/Datacenter where hardware is being virtualized and programmable through software, Applications are using a microservices-based approach. Networking has to be at pace with all these trends., IT teams need the skills to enable integration – and the hardware needs to be able to integrate. 
  <p>
    I created this website to put everythnig what is on my mind about Technology and in particular all things Networking from my eyes and experiences. Designed in a very plain text, this can be searched using browser tools. You wont find any chunky images, videos, or any advertisements.

      <ul>
        {% for entry in item.children %}
          <li><a href="{{ entry.url }}">{{ entry.title }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
